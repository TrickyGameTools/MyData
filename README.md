# MyData

This is a simple DataBase program that I use for game databases.
This application has been used in Dyrt, Star Story, Fairy Tale REVAMPED and more projects are likely to follow.

### NOTE:
For some reason the Mac version always crashes UNLESS you build the program in debug mode (that goes for Vanilla at least, as I never tried to get this to work in NG).
