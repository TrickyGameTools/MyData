# DISCONTINUED -- Replaced by new MyData version rewritten from scratch.

This project has been discontinued because it has been replaced by [MyData Mono](http://github.com/TrickyGameTools/MyData-Mono), which will henceforth just carry the name MyData.
I bid this version of MyData a fond adieu, as it allowed me to write my best RPG (up until now), but I will only maintain it due to it being compatible with the zlib driver (which the mono version is currently not) and that may be required to bugfix older games of mine.
It's also for this reason there is no issue tracker, or possibility to make pull-requests (and if you manage to send one in, I guess it's obvious it will be either ignored or denied). 

If you were using MyData, then fear not, the Mono version is completely backwards compatible and if some features are missing, they will be implemented very soon.
If you wanna take over the BlitzMax version of MyData (in case you prefer that over the Mono version for some reason... Who knows), just drop me a note in my issue tracker of the Mono version of MyData so we can discuss this.


# MyData

This is a simple DataBase program that I use for game databases.
This application has been used in Dyrt, Star Story, Fairy Tale REVAMPED and more projects are likely to follow.

### NOTE:
For some reason the Mac version always crashes UNLESS you build the program in debug mode (that goes for Vanilla at least, as I never tried to get this to work in NG).
